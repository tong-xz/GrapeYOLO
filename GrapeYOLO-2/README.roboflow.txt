The dataset includes 1124 images.
Grape are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random rotation of between -20 and +20 degrees

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
